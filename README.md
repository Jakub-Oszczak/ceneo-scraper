# ceneo-scraper

This program lets you search a product on ceneo.pl website and returns back information (scraped from the website) about the product such as best price, product image, seller's name and his logo.

While making this project I've learned how to scrape and control websites with selenium module and also I have further developed my object oriented programming skills.
